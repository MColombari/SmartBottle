# SmartBottle


Smart Bottle is a project developed by Pirelli Marco and Colombari Martina. for the course of IoT and 3D Intelligent System.
The project objective is to develop an ecosystem which help users improve their water drinking habit with an infrastructure of water dispenser and personal water bottle.


The Bottle is designed with modularity in mind, this helped achieve upgradability and reperability, while maintaining all the required feature.
The design has a very user oriented set of feature designed designed to make all the interaction as friendly and non invasive as possible, like the magnet connector to charge the system or the notification led ring that provide feedback to the user.
Thank to its modular design and open source internal architecture, we encourage user to get their hans on the system customize it.
